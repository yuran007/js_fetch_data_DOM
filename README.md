### Task: Fetch data

API Urls:
- List URL: https://mate-academy.github.io/phone-catalogue-static/api/phones.json
- Details URL: https://mate-academy.github.io/phone-catalogue-static/api/phones/:phoneId.json

The main goal of this task is practice of fetching data from API.
Your task is create function `getPhones` that should `resolve` with the list of phones or `reject` in `5` second.

After receiving list of phones get all IDs and fetch all details for these phone ids with function `getPhonesDetails`, which takes array of IDs.
`getPhonesDetails` should `resolve` with an array of details of each phone in the list or `reject` on any error.

Show phone names using the DOM.

(optional) Combine all data. Make array `phonesWithDetails`.
